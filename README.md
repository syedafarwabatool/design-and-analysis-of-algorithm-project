The Patient Management System (PMS) is a software application designed to manage patient records in a
hospital. It provides a user-friendly interface for healthcare administrators to efficiently handle patient data, including adding, displaying, searching (by name or ID), and removing patient records. The PMS aims to
automate patient management processes, reducing manual effort and increasing efficiency. The system is
connected to a MySQL database to securely store and retrieve patient information, while also tracking the
total execution time for database operations to monitor performance.
